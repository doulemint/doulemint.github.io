<p>Hi, I find this is find to record my writing about â€˜about meâ€™. Everytime I update it, it means I enter another level of my life or career. So Iâ€™ll keep them like 
an old photograph album.</p>
<div class="album">
<img src="/pics/me1.jpg" alt="Figure4" align="left" />
<img src="/pics/me3.jpg" alt="Figure4" align="center" />
<img src="/pics/me2.jpg" alt="Figure4" align="right" />

</div>

<p>Currently, Iâ€™m seeking a long term position as a engineer or related position to accumulate industry experience. Iâ€™ll graudate from RIT(Rochester Institude of Te
chnology) in June 2021.
My master study is mainly on how machine understand art and create it, please click project subsidebar to know more~</p>
