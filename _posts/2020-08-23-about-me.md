Hi, I find It's interesting to record my writing about 'about me'. Everytime I update it, it means I enter another level of my life or career. So I'll keep them like 
an old photograph album.
<div class="album">
<img src="/pics/me1.jpg"  alt="Figure4" align=left />
<img src="/pics/me3.jpg"   alt="Figure4" align=center />
<img src="/pics/me2.jpg"  alt="Figure4" align=right />

</div>

Currently, I'm seeking a long term position as a engineer or related position to accumulate industry experience. I'll graudate from RIT(Rochester Institude of Te
chnology) in June 2021.
My master study is mainly on how machine understand art and create it, please click project subsidebar to know more~
